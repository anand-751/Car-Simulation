**ðŸš— Driving Simulation Project: Interview Q\&A Cheat Sheet**

---

### 1. Why did you simulate instead of using actual hardware?

**Answer:** I initially intended to interface with real hardware (like a motor or wheel sensor) to stream live data into my C++ program. However, due to hardware unavailability and lack of tools like MATLAB Simulink, I built a realistic vehicle dynamics simulator using empirical logic and randomness to mimic behavior.

---

### 2. How is speed calculated?

**Answer:** Speed is derived by scaling the current RPM relative to the max RPM, adjusted by `speedFactor` and capped by the terrain-based speed limit:

```cpp
float kmph = clamp((rpm / maxRPM) * speedLimit * speedFactor, 0.0f, speedLimit);
```

---

### 3. What is the purpose of `speedFactor`?

**Answer:** It adjusts the proportionality between RPM and the actual vehicle speed, simulating effects like drag, incline, and drivetrain losses depending on driving style and terrain.

---

### 4. Why did you encapsulate logic inside a class?

**Answer:** To follow object-oriented principles for modularity, maintainability, and future extension (e.g., multi-vehicle support, external data injection).

---

### 5. How would you add support for real-time sensor data?

**Answer:** I'd replace the simulated noise and throttle values with live data streamed via serial/CAN bus interfaces and refactor my class to accept input streams.

---

### 6. How does the dynamic mileage calculation work?

**Answer:** It uses a formula based on the efficiency drop from the optimal RPM zone. As RPM deviates, mileage decreases non-linearly.

---

### 7. Why use `deque` for mileage history?

**Answer:** `deque` supports efficient insertion/removal from both ends, ideal for maintaining a sliding window of recent mileage readings.

---

### 8. What challenges did you face?

**Answer:** Lack of hardware forced me to simulate realistic behavior manually. Creating smooth, realistic dynamics while keeping it understandable and modular in C++ was also a challenge.

---

### 9. What would you improve if you had more time/resources?

**Answer:** I'd connect it to real vehicle sensors, visualize the simulation via a GUI or live plot, and separate logic into more specialized classes.

---

### 10. How is this relevant to an embedded systems or automotive role?

**Answer:** This project mimics real-world vehicle behavior, emphasizes C++ simulation, and shows my readiness to work with hardware integration, real-time data, and performance-efficient code, all of which are crucial in such domains.
